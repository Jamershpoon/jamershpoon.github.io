                <h3><strong><em>Story Prompt: </em></strong>It was that fleeting hour of the day when the moon and sun are high and bright at the same time. Like many things in my life, these summer nights wouldn't last much longer. I sat quietly on a...</h3>

                    ... tree stump overlooking the villages and bay area. The wind rustled through the trees as it climbed up the hill and brought cherry blossom petals with it. The sky was turning a golden red colour. I looked out over the village as the people started to return to normal. My attention was drawn to a dragonfly as it buzzed through the air amongst the cherry blossom petals. It landed gently on my hat which rested atop the makeshift grave I made for the old couple who looked after me.<br><br>
                    A faint smile crept across my face. Their generosity and kindness was more than I deserved or could’ve hoped for. At least their house remained standing, I thought as I looked back towards it just in time to see part of the chimney fall through the front porch, well most of it anyway.<br><br>
                    Thinking back like this made no sense. It always gets me so angry. It always ends up with those who show me kindness dying. Dying to hide me. Dying to protect me. For what? Their book tells a story and I’m the bad guy? All I’ve ever done is run. All they’ve done is hunt, preach and persecute. Just because I have a mark. The mark which ends it all apparently. Allegedly.<br><br>
                    My existence would mark the end of their rule. So made sense, I guess. Ending me would sort out all their problems. But this seemed different. They were either trying to catch me or stop me from running. <br><br>
                    So now it makes sense. Time to stop running. Fight back to end them before they end me.
